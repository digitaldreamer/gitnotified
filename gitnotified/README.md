# Git Notified - pre-alpha

This project is meant to provide a more elegant way to keep up to date with actions happening on repos that you want to watch.

I've found it impossible to have one place that properly notifies me of relevant repo activity. It's either incomplete, noisy, and spread across different pages. This project is an attempt to aggregate everything you want to pay attention to and present it into one unified view that's easy to keep track and understand.

The project is in early development stages. Feedback and code contributions is greatly appreciated.

# Tech Stack
